# Mission_to_Mars
## Overview
In this week's project, I built an interactive webpage that scrapped different websites, collected information and images, and put everything into one webpage that shows the latest content for missions to mars. 

## Purpose
- Use HTML elements to build a webpage and identify contents for web scraping
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a browser and scrap data
- Use MongoDB database to store data I scraped from different websites
- Create a web app with Flask to display the web scraping results
- Use Bootstrap components to style the webpage
